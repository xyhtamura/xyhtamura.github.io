                    An intermedia poetic suite that explores liminality across personal and cultural domains. This the Master's Thesis I'm developing for my Creative Writing degree. You can click the title "Of Another Shore" to see the full list of works. It functions as a  network of art pieces, combining electronic literature, experimental music, and web art like a multimedia concept album that is not just songs.

					The piece I presented at Saliksik-Musika II is part of this, and I have not finished recording it, <a href="nightbus.mp3" target="_blank">a part of it can be listened to</a>, as well as my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sG_RF0JtRE9HJ7z-F_5hySmsjb9Hl2_bif4hd9YNY1E/edit?usp=sharing"target="_blank">still incomplete paper for it</a>, in which I try to tackle the problem of how classical contermpoary music, pop music, contemporary poetry, and electronic music can collide.

                    A project exploring the primordial Hadean eon through atonal/microtonal music, video art, and custom software. This might be more interesting to you, since the composition of it is atonal, microtonal, and atempo. The first piece, "Init" was made from Windows start up sounds and natural sounds, the second piece "Roil" was made with my own custom digital synthesizer and Philippine instruments played by Tusa Montes, and the third "Theia" is a vocal-synth piece constructed with hertz based melodies as opposed to scale based or 12-TET.</p><p> The project includes a suite of custom web-based tools, which I programmed: 
					<a href="https://xyhtochrome.bandcamp.com/album/eosforos" target="_blank">Roil</a>, an Oscillator with aperiodic noise modulations;
					<a href="https://xyhtochrome.bandcamp.com/album/eosforos" target="_blank">Hadean Flare</a>, Algorithmic graphics based on Perlin noise and domain warping; and 
					<a href="https://xyhtochrome.bandcamp.com/album/eosforos" target="_blank">Antemelos</a>, Non-scale-based, hertz-based atonal/microtonal vocal melody generator.
